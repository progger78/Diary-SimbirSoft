&emsp; :eight_pointed_black_star: Firstly, you can add your tasks for the chosen time and see them in a calendar. The time interval scheduled for a specific task is highlighted in the calendar according to the specified day and time you've chosen before. It's quite straightforward without any difficult ways to handle it so you can easily be in touch with the things you need to do during the day. <br /> <br />

&emsp; :eight_pointed_black_star: Secondly, while being on a calendar screen you can tap a particular task for the specified time interval of your task to read what's inside a time block.<br /> <br />

&emsp; :file_folder: ***All the information is kept locally**, that's why you don't lose a track of your tasks and won't have any trouble if you would need to load them from the internet.* <br />
&emsp; :bulb: *This application has been created with MVVM pattern which in this case might suit better for possible perspectives to extend the scale when needed.* <br />
&emsp; :heart: Thanks for your time getting familiar with the project. :heart:
